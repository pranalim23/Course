Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Pranali Mane
Divide and Conquer Algorithms
This technique can be divided into the following three parts:
1.Divide: involves dividing the problem into smaller sub-problems.
2.Conquer: Solve sub-problems by calling recursively until solved.
3.Combine: Combine the sub-problems to get the final solution of the whole problem.
